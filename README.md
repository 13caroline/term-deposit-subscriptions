# Forecast of term deposit subscriptions 

The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing">dataset</a> refers to direct _telemarketing_ campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, carried out between May 2008 and November 2010. 

Sales campaigns are a typical strategy to increase turnover. Companies use _direct marketing_ to contact certain customers in order to achieve stipulated sales targets. Centralization of remote customer interactions facilitate operational management of campaigns. These interactions take place through different means, with the telephone (landline or mobile) being one of the most used (_telemarketing_). 

### Goal

The goal of this study is to correctly predict whether the client intends to sign, or has signed, a term deposit, assuming the value of the variable of interest. Thus, _Machine Learning_ methods will be applied, as well as _Deep Learning_, including the optimization of hyperparameters, in an attempt to improve the results obtained.
